# Hanno Playbooks: 2014-2019

In Hanno's past, we [published](https://hanno.co/journal/defaulting-to-transparency/) and maintained a series of _Playbooks_ detailing how Hanno operated as a distributed team.

These played a central role in documenting what, at the time, was considered an unconventional way of working, and were widely shared, both within the design community and across other industries.

However, as we began to [focus our attention on the healthcare industry](https://hanno.co/journal/focus-health-sustainability/), we increasingly felt that the content in these Playbooks was becoming less relevant to those outside of the team and also harder to openly share and maintain, due to us operating in a more regulated space.

For this reason, we decided in November 2020 to remove the content from the Hanno website and instead, to preserve it as a snapshot in time in this GitHub repository.

We're proud of what these Playbooks stood for, both within our own team and also for the community at large. We hope you enjoy this nod to Hannoâ€™s history.
