# Equipment Recommendations

<p>When you're in a remote team, you need to make sure you're well set up to be productive, communicate effectively, and to stay healthy.</p><p>We believe that investing in decent equipment is a decision that pays for itself over time, so we have a generous equipment budget available for accessories and also to help you set up an ergonomic home office for those working from home.</p><h2>Microphones</h2><p>The microphone on your laptop is <strong>not good enough</strong> for working in a serious remote environment. You'll need to pick up a replacement which is one of the following:</p><ul><li><strong>A <a href="http://thewirecutter.com/reviews/best-usb-office-headset/">headset mic</a>&nbsp;or a <a href="http://thewirecutter.com/reviews/best-gaming-headset/">gaming headset</a></strong> which holds the microphone in front of your face, rather than hanging down near your neck.</li><li><strong>A <a href="http://thewirecutter.com/reviews/the-best-usb-microphone/">desktop mic</a></strong>. The <a href="https://www.amazon.co.uk/dp/B00VTI0WKK">Audio-Technica AT2020USBI</a> is our current pick as a strong performer if you aren't relocating frequently and have a private office to work from. You'll need a desk mount or a <a href="https://www.amazon.co.uk/dp/B001D7UYBO/">boom arm</a> with a shock mount in order to use it effectively.</li><li><strong>A <a href="https://www.amazon.com/s/ref=nb_sb_noss_2?field-keywords=clip+on+microphone">clip-on microphone</a></strong>&nbsp;- although you will need to hold this near to your mouth in order to get good audio, so this is a distinct third choice.</li></ul><h2>Webcams</h2>

<p>Just like the microphone, the built-in webcam on your computer is a weak option for serious remote work.</p><p>Our current tried and tested recommendations are based on the <a href="https://thewirecutter.com/reviews/the-best-webcams/">Wirecutter recommendations</a>:</p><ul><li><strong><a title="Logitech C920 1080p Webcam" href="https://www.amazon.co.uk/dp/B07MM4V7NR/">Logitech HD Pro Webcam C920S</a>&nbsp;</strong>is an affordable and very effective camera&nbsp;</li><li><strong><a title="Logitech BRIO 4k Webcam" href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B01N5UOYC4">The Logitech BRIO</a></strong> is used by a few of us (especially those with very stable home office setups), but is usually not worth the premium price.</li></ul><h2>Laptop Stands</h2><p>Don't hunch over a laptop and screw up your spine! Most of us have laptop stands for travelling, even if we have home offices.</p><p><a href="https://thewirecutter.com/reviews/best-laptop-stands/">Check out laptop stand recommendations on Wirecutter</a>.</p><h2>Keyboard</h2><p>This is quite a personal decision but the main upshot is that you probably shouldn't be using that built in laptop keyboard if you're spending 8 hours a day in front of your computer.</p><p>Whichever keyboard you buy,&nbsp;don't forget that if you put it in your suitcase and travel with it, there's a high chance that one of the keys will pop off and break, rendering it useless. So, take precautions! Wrap the keyboard up in cloth, or buy some sort of carrying case for it&nbsp;ðŸ˜‰</p><p><a href="https://thewirecutter.com/reviews/the-best-bluetooth-keyboard/">Check out keyboard recommendations on Wirecutter</a>.</p><h2>Mouse</h2><p>Just as with your keyboard, your laptop's trackpad is no good for extended work. Getting an ergonomic mouse will help keep your wrists healthy.</p><p>Most of the team use and endorse the Logitech MX range. The <strong>Performance MX</strong> and the <strong>MX Master</strong> are both good options.</p><p><a href="https://thewirecutter.com/reviews/best-wireless-mouse/">Check out mouse recommendations on Wirecutter</a>.</p><p><a href="http://thewirecutter.com/reviews/best-wireless-mouse/"></a></p><h2>Other kit</h2><p>Ask the team if you'd like more advice on chairs, desks (including building your own standing desk) and other stuff. As long-term remotees, we have a lot of knowledge on this stuff!</p>
