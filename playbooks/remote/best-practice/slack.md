# Using Slack

<p>As with most other remote teams, we use Slack for internal chatter, direct messaging and general chat between shipmates which is 'live' and doesn't need to be tracked forever.</p>
<h2>Think before you ping!</h2>
<p>There's a downside, though: it's easy to ping someone on Slack and request something, but that can be super disruptive and make it hard to get anything done.</p>
<p>That's why we have an internal rule for all tasks which aren't <em>world-endingly urgent</em>: <strong>default to Asana.</strong></p>
<p>Tasks in Asana are easy to spot and easy for the other person to tackle on their own schedule. That's the fair way to communicate with your team!</p>
<h2>&nbsp;</h2>
<p><em>We'll be updating this page soon with more Slacktiquette!</em></p>
