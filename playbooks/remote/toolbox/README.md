# Culture Toolbox

And we're slowly documenting a toolbox of exercises that we use to improve team culture.

## Contents

- **[Buddy Calls](/playbooks/remote/toolbox/buddy-calls.md)**: Pairing up once a week to make sure everyone's feeling supported
- **[Pairing](/playbooks/remote/toolbox/pairing.md)**: Just because we're not in the same office doesn't mean we can't work on problems together.
- **[Monthly 1:1 Calls](/playbooks/remote/toolbox/1-1-calls.md)**: Our monthly 1:1s allow us to talk deeply about the challenges we're facing at work.
- **[Team Feedback](/playbooks/remote/toolbox/feedback.md)**: Sharing team feedback in real-time on a team feedback call.
- **[The Weekly Team Hangout](/playbooks/remote/toolbox/weekly-hangout.md)**: Once a week, we all jump on a call together to hang out and socialise.
- **[CHICO](/playbooks/remote/toolbox/chico.md)**: Adopting a habit of checking in and out can be the glue which keeps a remote team together.
- **[PPPs](/playbooks/remote/toolbox/ppp.md)**: Plans, Progress and Problems. A simple structure for regular updates that cut through the chaos.
- **[Retrospectives](/playbooks/remote/toolbox/retrospectives.md)**: While far from unique to remote workers, this is a valuable tool to use to debug many events.
