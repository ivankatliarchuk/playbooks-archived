# CHICO

<p>We built a friendly Slackbot called <a href="http://oskar.hanno.co/">Oskar</a>. Somewhat confusingly for new arrivals, inside the Hanno Slack, Oskar is known as Jazz!</p>
<p>Jazz will ping us twice a day to ask how we're feeling, and the results will be shared in our <strong>Chico</strong> channel in Asana.</p>
<p>We ecourage the team to be open with Jazz as it's our primary way to keep in touch with the team and see how our workmates are feeling. If we know a shipmate is struggling, we'll do our best to rally round them and give them a boost.</p>
