# Monthly 1:1 Calls

<div class="markdown-body">
<p>One of our most important cultural values is that we will <a href="https://hanno.co/playbooks/ops/mission/values/">never settle</a>. This means we work really hard to help our shipmates grow.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em><strong>These calls were originally carried out by <a href="https://hanno.co/team/jon/">Jon</a>. As we scale, we're gradually going to transition them to a team responsibility, as far as possible.</strong></em></p>
</blockquote>
<h2>Structure</h2>
<p>We'll need:</p>
<ul>
<li>A coach</li>
<li>A subject</li>
</ul>
<p>You'll have 2x calls per month. One as the coach, and the other as the subject. The goal is to speak for 1hr on each call so that you get a proper space to talk about what you're struggling with.</p>
<h2>Ahead of the call</h2>
<p>The coach will send over a brief 'conversation starter' to the shipmate a day or two ahead of the call with two pieces of feedback:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Here's something I thought you did really well last month...</strong> <em>I'd like to recognise your hard work on this.</em></li>
<li><strong>Here's something that you seemed to be struggling with...</strong> <em>I'd like to hear your side of the story on this, so I can understand your problem better.</em></li>
</ol>
<p>And for prep work:</p>
<ul>
<li>The shipmate should ensure their OKRs are up-to-date</li>
<li>Both the shipmate and the coach should review the shipmate's OKRs</li>
<li>A time slot should be booked into their calendars</li>
</ul>
<h2>The call</h2>
<h3>What's on your mind?</h3>
<p>The format of the call is up to the participants. But we usually:</p>
<ul>
<li>Kick off with this question: <em>"What's on your mind?"</em></li>
<li>Dedicate some time to talking about what was good</li>
<li>Dedicate some more time to talking about tough problems and challenges, both last month, and also coming up soon</li>
<li>Discuss progress on their OKRs</li>
</ul>
<h3>Ground Rules</h3>
<ul>
<li>The shipmate leads the call and talks about things they want to discuss.</li>
<li><strong>The coach is not a manager</strong>. The coach should not give commands or prescriptions--they're only able to ask questions and offer advice if that's requested. But they should actively avoid trying to impose their views onto the situation. They're there as a sounding board, not a problem-fixer.</li>
</ul>
