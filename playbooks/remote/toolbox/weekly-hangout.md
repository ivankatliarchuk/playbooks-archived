# The Weekly Team Hangout

<p>We also have a recurring calendar event for a weekly team call, once a week on <strong>Wednesdays</strong> on Zoom. This is usually fixed around 11:00 GMT, but the timing occasionally changes if a lot of the team is on an awkward timezone (for example, in the USA).</p>
<p>We track the discussion topics and progresss from previous calls <a href="https://trello.com/b/5dvspldw/weekly-team-hangout">on a Trello board</a>&nbsp;(visble to Hanno shipmates):</p>

<p>The weekly Hangout is not compulsory if you have a big schedule clash or important commitment, but since it's the 1 time each week where we're all together, it's <strong>strongly recommended</strong> that everyone jumps in to say hello and participate, even just for part of the call.</p>
