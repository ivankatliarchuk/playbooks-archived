# Our tech stack

<h3>JavaScript</h3>
<p>Our current stack is based on the latest version of JavaScript, EcmaScript 2015 (or ES6). When not working with node.js (which already supports a lot of ES6 features), we transpile ES6 code using <a href="https://babeljs.io/">Babel</a>.</p>
<h3>Build tools</h3>
<p>As a build tool, we mainly use <a href="https://webpack.github.io/">Webpack</a>, but also have experience using <a href="http://gulpjs.com/">Gulp</a> and <a href="https://gruntjs.com/">Grunt</a>. With the release of Webpack 2, which has a strong community, extensive plugin system and huge flexibility, we advocate for using it on most our projects.</p>
<h3>Front-end libraries and frameworks</h3>
<p>Depending on the project needs, we typically use either <a href="https://facebook.github.io/react/">React</a> or <a href="https://angular.io/">Angular</a>. Both are great options, and our choice usually comes down to the needs of the project.</p>
<p>Even though React is just a view layer for your app, it has a great ecosystem many add-ons for the model/controller layer to build more complex apps, such as <a href="http://redux.js.org/">Redux</a> or <a href="https://github.com/mobxjs/mobx">MobX</a>.</p>
<p>By contrast, Angular comes with a lot of pre-defined structure and tells you how to lay out your app and components. It also enables developers to write more HTML-like code with React and is a great choice when prototyping app ideas quickly.</p>
