<h3>Frameworks</h3>
<p>To save time and money, we avoid building the HTML/CSS structure from scratch and rely on pre-built framework solutions instead.</p>
<p>In the past, we&rsquo;ve used both, <a href="http://foundation.zurb.com/">Foundation</a> and <a href="http://getbootstrap.com/">Bootstrap</a>. Nowadays, we&rsquo;re more inclined to use Foundation as most of us are more familiar with it, and we think it&rsquo;s the more robust and advanced solution.</p>
<p>Since we do a lot of prototyping, building the basic HTML and CSS boilerplate usually feels like a huge waste of time. That&rsquo;s why we usually start out by using a front-end UI framework to provide a responsive grid, some solid UI components and the usual JavaScript enhancements that you&rsquo;d need in every project.</p>
<p>We then tweak the existing grid, default styles (like colours and margins/padding) and UI components to our needs. From our experience, there is no faster way than this to quickly prototype a new product idea and put it in the hand of our users.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s very rare that we&rsquo;d write the entire CSS for an application from scratch, simply because of the huge technical and maintenance effort that this requires. It&rsquo;s usually something we recommend against since the baseline styles included in these CSS frameworks have been tested in the wild by millions of people and provide a decent experience on a huge number of platforms and devices.</p>
<p>That said, in a few cases we have taken on this task and are experienced with and open to use more minimal solutions such as <a href="https://purecss.io/">Pure CSS</a> or something less opinionated and more flexible like <a href="http://susy.oddbird.net/">Susy</a>. In the end, it&rsquo;s all about catering to the project&rsquo;s requirements and setting up a speedy and streamlined development process.</p>
<h3>Our workflow</h3>
<p>We make heavy use of <a href="http://sass-lang.com/">SASS</a> for better organisation of styles, integrated into a solid build process (e.g. Webpack, Grunt or <a href="https://middlemanapp.com/">Middleman</a>). We highly recommend using preprocessors to increase readability and maintainability of your CSS.</p>
