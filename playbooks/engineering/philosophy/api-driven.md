# Adopt an API-driven approach

<p>We&rsquo;ve been approached a couple of times by startups who had already built out their entire backend and API, but asked us to help out with the front-end/UI development. This is a very common approach (especially in mobile development) as you don&rsquo;t have to share any sensitive information about your business, and the mobile team can focus all their efforts on building a solid user interface, accessing the application logic only via its public API endpoints.</p>
<p>We have built apps this way before (e.g. <a href="https://hanno.co/work/prepd/">Prepd</a> and <a href="https://hanno.co/work/mirror/">Mirror</a>) and would be able to build a prototype based on the mockups you&rsquo;ve put together.</p>
<p>We recommend the following process to get to market in the most efficient way and with as little risk as possible:</p>
<ol>
<li>Pick the most critical, easily buildable features of your app. Prioritise features based on business/user value and cost/complexity. Build the most cost-effective features first.</li>
<li>Build the first prototype as quickly as possible</li>
<li>Roll out a beta version, and start doing user tests to validate the product. Get user feedback and do extensive testing.</li>
<li>Only start adding new features after your business idea has been sufficiently validated.</li>
</ol>
