# Clients own the code

<p>Code ownership is a big deal for us. When a sprint ends, it&rsquo;s crucial that everything we&rsquo;ve done is owned by the client, and can be used by them going forwards. This means that whenever we use a third-party service (like GitHub, <a href="http://heroku.com/">Heroku</a>, etc), we set up the project in an account under the client&rsquo;s name, <strong>not</strong> on one of our existing internal accounts.</p>
<p>When working on GitHub, we strongly push for the repository to be hosted on the client&rsquo;s own GitHub account, not our own. By the time the sprint ends, the idea is to seamlessly transition the project across to the client&rsquo;s own team to manage and maintain on a daily basis.</p>
<p>After the week&rsquo;s invoice has been paid in full, all code produced in that week is considered to be owned by the client.</p>
<h2>How to set up a GitHub account when working with Hanno</h2>
<p>If you're a client and we're coding an app or product for you, GitHub is almost certainly going to be used. If we ask you to set up a GitHub organisation for us, here's how you can do this.</p>
<h3>Create a personal GitHub account</h3>
<p>First, you'll need an account for yourself as an individual. Visit <a href="http://github.com/">github.com</a> and sign up.</p>
<p>Select the <strong>free</strong> option for now and make sure to click the <strong>Help me set up an organization next</strong> checkbox on this page.</p>

<h3>Send us your logins</h3>
<p>Share your login info with our team and we'll set up the correct settings and invite the right team members to the project.</p>
