# Don't reinvent the wheel

<p>At Hanno, we&rsquo;re big fans of the <a href="https://leanvalidation.hanno.co/">lean approach.</a> And that also applies to our engineering work.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s why we employ things like boilerplates and third-party plugins wherever we can (as long as we feel they&rsquo;re robust) to speed up our development process.</p>
<p>Here's an example:</p>
<p>Many web apps nowadays need a store with an integrated back-office system to manage orders, stock, invoices etc. While doing this from scratch sounds like an interesting challenge, it&rsquo;s like reinventing the wheel. And it not only costs you time and money but also a lot of nerves along the way.</p>
<p>A common solution here would be to build your shop with a pre-built solution (e.g. Shopify or Eventbrite) as it already provides all of these features out of the box. You may have a bit less flexibility when it comes to customising things like the check-out process or styling, but the development time you save by not building your own solution is invaluable.</p>
<p><em>That&rsquo;s why we usually advocate for ready-built solutions where possible: they might not be 100% customizable, but at least they allow us to validate an early-stage idea and product. The success of a product is more important than a losing sleep over an invoice template and those development hours can be spent on more productive tasks.</em></p>
