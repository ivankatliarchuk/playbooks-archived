# Chatbots

<p>With a growing number of teams using <a href="https://slack.com/">Slack</a>&nbsp;to communicate, and the power of AI growing ever stronger, it doesn't always make sense to build a web app that requires a keyboard and mouse to navigate.</p>
<p>We got started building bots when we built <a href="http://oskar.hanno.co/">our own Slackbot</a>&nbsp;to improve our internal culture at Hanno and save time across the team.</p>
<p>Our UX team has also worked with several clients to devise conversational, AI-driven interfaces for <a href="https://hanno.co/work/ava/">app onboarding</a> and event creation.</p>
<p>We're also able to create bots for the <a href="https://messenger.fb.com/">Facebook Messenger Platform</a>&nbsp;and other services, to help with customer acquisition, support and engagement.</p>
