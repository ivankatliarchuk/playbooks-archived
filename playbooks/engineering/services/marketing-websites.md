# Marketing websites

<p>Engineering work for &lsquo;marketing websites&rsquo; is essentially frontend development for web pages you use to market your business: your public facing website rather than your app or &ldquo;product&rdquo;.</p>
<p>We work closely with either the Hanno design team or with your own designers, to make sure that the website which gets delivered performs brilliantly on a technical level.</p>
<p>The focus is usually on the content and design though rather than on heavy engineering and technical work: we usually work with a design team of three people (including designers and content strategists) with one or two developers in a supporting role.</p>
<h3>Our marketing site development approach</h3>
<p>When building marketing sites, even Hanno&rsquo;s designers will typically start <a href="https://logbook.hanno.co/why-designing-in-the-browser-is-the-way-forward/">designing and prototyping ideas in code</a> as soon as possible. Even if our designers are working with Sketch, our aim is to quickly move things into code so we can test solutions with potential customers/user, gather feedback and then incorporate that feedback into our next iteration.</p>
<h3>Content delivery and hosting</h3>
<p>We&rsquo;re flexible about content delivery for marketing sites: either we&rsquo;ll connect a content API to enable our client to manage their own content, or if they&rsquo;re tech-savvy and have a team who are comfortable tweaking HTML, we might deliver the site as a static website. It really depends on the client, timeline and budget.</p>
