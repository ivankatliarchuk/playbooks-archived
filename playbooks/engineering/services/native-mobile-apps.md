# Native mobile apps

<p>We take a platform-agnostic approach to building mobile apps: the tools we use depend on the needs of the project at hand.</p>
<h3>Fully native iOS and Android apps</h3>
<p>Where a complex app is to be built and project budget and timelines permit, our preference is to build fully native applications - this gives us the most control over what's going on under the hood.</p>
<p>It means we can deliver a lightning fast, high quality product with a great user experience that is easy to maintain. On iOS we use <a href="https://developer.apple.com/swift/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Swift</a> (which we have particularly deep experience with) and on Android we use <a href="https://kotlinlang.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Kotlin</a>.</p>
<h3>Cross-platform apps</h3>
<p>That said, building a fully native app is not always the best route forwards. When that's the case, we build cross platform apps with <a href="https://flutter.dev/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Flutter</a> and&nbsp;<a href="https://facebook.github.io/react-native/">React Native</a>. We're especially enjoying Flutter's recent development and it's already a firm favourite in our engineering team.</p>
<p>A good example of one of our recent cross-platform projects is the app we launched with <a href="https://hanno.co/work/prepd/">Prepd</a> to support their viral Kickstarter campaign:</p>

<h3>Hybrid apps</h3>
<p>In some cases, particularly on fast paced <a title="Based on the Google Ventures model: collaborating to build ideas and prototypes for applications in a couple of days." href="https://hanno.co/playbooks/ops/services/product-design-sprints">product design sprints</a> where an MVP needs to get to the app store but timeline and budget are very short, we also build hybrid apps using tools such as <a href="http://ionic.io/2">Ionic</a>, or progressive web apps (PWAs), typically using <a href="https://reactjs.org/">React</a>.</p>
<p>While an app built using this method won't feel or perform quite like a true native app, it can nevertheless be a useful way to build simple mobile apps very efficiently. We'll often recommend hybrid apps to clients on a tight budget, or those who want to launch and validate a simple app as quickly as possible before taking on the more significant investment required to build a more production-ready native app.</p>
<h3>Accessibility</h3>
<p>Not everyone uses their device in the same way, and for that reason we believe in making apps accessible. In most cases, this means the app will at the least react to the zoom setting available on mobile devices. This is surprisingly easy to achieve, but it really improves the experience for those who have impaired vision, and ultimately results in a much higher quality app. It also improves the chances of your app getting featured on Apple and Google's app stores!</p>
<p>There are a lot of other things we can do to make your app highly accessible: we'll work with you to decide which of them make sense for your project.</p>
<h3>Testing</h3>
<p>Whatever approach we take to building your app, you can rest assured that it'll be well tested. Having a well tested app is part of delivering a high quality product, particularly when you have ISO or IEC compliance requirements to meet. As part of our development approach, we adopt industry best practices to ensure your code is watertight. That includes writing unit, UI and integration tests.</p>
