# Social Media

<p>We actively maintain a few social profiles:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://twitter.com/wearehanno">Twitter</a>: this is our top priority for social media, and is actively maintained and pushed.</li>
<li><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/company/2561145">LinkedIn</a>: we post to this via cross-posting, rather than actively pushing it. It drives a very small amount of traffic due to our limited follower count.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Social strategy</h2>
<ul>
<li>Produce high-quality original content on our website, particularly on our blog. Post this to social channels and promote it actively when it publishes. See <a class="internal absent" href="https://hanno.co/playbooks/ops/marketing/blogging/">Blogging</a>.</li>
<li>Collate and share links to high-quality resources around the web, particularly ones related to UX, remote working, and product design.</li>
<li>Showcase the team's remote working culture and personality through posts&nbsp;like team member birthday shoutouts; fun screenshots of video calls &amp; Slack chats; pictures of team members hanging out whenever they meet up/work together.</li>
<li>When the opportunity is present, vary engagement by re-tweeting articles &amp; mentioning the authors.</li>
<li>Share inspirational quotes on design, social good, transparency, UX and anything else that Hanno represents.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Tips for sharing content</h3>
<p>Here are some tips from the <a href="https://app.coschedule.com/#/course/1">CoSchedule Master Class</a> on how to generate more shares in social media.</p>
<ol>
<li>Make it direct and easy</li>
<li>Ask a question</li>
<li>Cite a fact</li>
<li>Share a tweetable quote</li>
<li>Add intrigue</li>
</ol>
<h3>Pablo guidelines</h3>
<p>Buffer has created a tool called <a href="https://buffer.com/pablo">Pablo</a> that allows us to create more appealing tweet images within seconds. Feel free to bookmark it for quick reference. Here are some guidelines to help us make those images more consistent:</p>
<ul>
<li>You should choose a background image that's somehow related to the post's content. You can always use the blog post's featured image as well.</li>
<li>Use the font "Merriweather" with a font size of "large" and a font weight of "light" (in the Advanced settings)</li>
<li>Add the white Hanno logo in the lower left corner so it's easily recognisable. All logo files can be found on <a href="https://drive.google.com/drive/u/0/folders/0B2UD3H1ttTKXU1VVakZyN0dSdEk/0B2UD3H1ttTKXWHJjWWxWaE5PZVE/0B2UD3H1ttTKXZ1VqV0JZazl1NkE/0B2UD3H1ttTKXRWE1YVgwUW5SV00/0B5UmAyqOMMRINFE0RFhBbEhNUms">Google Drive</a> under <code>Hanno Team &gt; Hanno Marketing &gt; _Branding &gt; _Logos &gt; Hanno</code></li>
</ul>
<p>Here's an example:</p>

<h2>Tools</h2>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://app.coschedule.com/#/calendar/15197/schedule">CoSchedule</a> is what we use to manage our content strategy timeline. Check out the <a class="internal absent" href="https://github.com/wearehanno/playbook/wiki/Blogging">Blogging</a> section for more information. It's also what we use to schedule social shares.</li>
<li><a href="http://buffer.com/">Buffer</a> is posted to via CoSchedule, and manages post ordering each day.</li>
<li>Create engaging images to go with posts using <a href="https://pablo.buffer.com/">Pablo</a> or&nbsp;<a href="https://www.canva.com/">Canva</a>.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Team Roles for social marketing</h2>
<h3>All shipmates (ongoing)</h3>
<p>While reading stuff online, gather links and drop them into the #tweetme channel on Slack. Please share:</p>
<ol>
<li>The link itself</li>
<li>Ideally, an example tweet.</li>
<li>Find the Twitter handle of the person who wrote the resource.</li>
</ol>
<p>For example, you might pen the following sample tweet:</p>
<p><em>"Check out this fantastic guide to running better user interviews, via @smashingmag: <a href="http://thelinkgoeshere.com/">http://thelinkgoeshere.com</a>"</em></p>
<h3>The social curator</h3>
<p>This is a single person in the team who takes charge of managing social media. They have the following weekly activities:</p>
<ol>
<li>Work through the #tweetme Slack channel, gathering all the suggested tweets from the past week, and schedule these shares for the next week using CoSchedule. The primary channel is Twitter, but sharing to LinkedIn too can also be worthwhile.</li>
<li>Respond to every interaction on Twitter and LinkedIn. This might have to be done a few times week, especially if somebody has reached out to us about something more urgent.</li>
<li>Use CoSchedule to re-share one of our older posts. There's a function inside CoSchedule to do this. Visit <em>New &gt; Social Message &gt; Share Old Post</em>.</li>
</ol>
