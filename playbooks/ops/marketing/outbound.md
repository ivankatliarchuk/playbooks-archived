# Outbound Marketing

<h2>Our approach to Outbound</h2>
<p>After many years working very hard to try and generate "buzz" around the Hanno brand with viral side projects, we came to the realisation that for a business of our size&nbsp;<strong>outbound marketing has vastly more ROI than inbound marketing</strong>.</p>
<p>We also realised that trying to be a generalist agency was something of a fools errand. That's why we started to <a href="https://hanno.co/blog/focus-health-sustainability/">narrow down on a niche</a>&nbsp;and subsequently decided to focus our time entirely on health and wellness projects.</p>
<p>The advantage of this is that it makes outbound marketing far more natural. Instead of sending out spammy messages to every startup in existence, we can focus our time on doing good networking with other people who are experts in the same Healthcare space.</p>
<p>The goal with our outbound marketing is to speak to experts who we could help, or who could help Hanno. The more people we know and engage with, the more we'll be able to act as a&nbsp;<strong>connector</strong> in the digital health design space and link together others in our network who could benefit from knowing each other.</p>
<p>We feel this is a much better way to do outbound marketing which delivers value for everyone involved.</p>
<h2>Our Platform</h2>
<p>Managing a lot of relationships is difficult.</p>
<p>Having explored many different platforms that we weren't happy with, we're now using <a href="https://www.hubspot.com/">HubSpot</a> to manage our current pitches and relationships with past, current and future clients.</p>
