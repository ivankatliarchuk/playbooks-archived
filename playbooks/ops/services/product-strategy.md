# Product strategy

<p>We're all for lean, iterative design and experimentation as you build out a new product. Hacking together prototypes on the fly is a huge part of what we do.</p>
<p>But once you get beyond hacking and have a validated prototype that you're about to pour serious investment into, it's no good to just keep coding away and hope for the best. <strong>You need a product strategy</strong>.</p>
<p>Given our experience with the whole cycle of product development, from&nbsp;<a href="https://hanno.co/playbooks/ops/services/user-research/">user research</a>&nbsp;to UX design to&nbsp;<a href="https://hanno.co/playbooks/ops/services/product-engineering/">product engineering</a>, we're also brilliantly placed to help teams to identify their <strong>product strategy.</strong></p>
<p>And as their product evolves, our&nbsp;<strong>product management&nbsp;</strong>support can help them stay on track.</p>
<h3>What is a product strategy?</h3>
<p>A product strategy isn't a rigid plan or roadmap for what to do and build for the next X months. All that delivers is a dangerous illusion of certainty and confidence.</p>
<p>To get to a product strategy, we need to understand:</p>
<ul>
<li>Your <strong>user goals</strong> and <strong>objectives</strong></li>
<li>Your <strong>business objectives</strong> and context (including your cash runway and other factors)</li>
</ul>
<p>And ultimately we need to end up with a <em>product strategy</em> which sets out:</p>
<ul>
<li>A clear <strong>vision</strong> for where your company needs to get to</li>
<li>The next big <strong>challenge</strong>&nbsp;in the customer journey (ideally in a quantitative way) which we can use to focus all of our upcoming product development around.</li>
</ul>
<h3>What can we help with?</h3>
<p>We can help you figure out the answers to tricky questions like:</p>
<ul>
<li>What do our users need: how can start talking to them and how can we learn which features will deliver most value?</li>
<li>How should we balance our budget and long-term roadmap to decide which features to include in our&nbsp;<em>minimum viable product</em> (MVP)?</li>
<li>How should we prioritise our long-term feature backlog?</li>
<li>What's the best approach to take our product to market?</li>
<li>Would it make sense to switch component X in our 'stack' to a new framework?</li>
<li>How can we change our team's way of working to improve our product&nbsp;</li>
</ul>
<h3>Product strategy as standard</h3>
<p>Product strategy is an almost essential part of most of our product design and engineering projects. If we're being brought in to build a new feature or to design a whole product from scratch, it's impossible for us to approach that task without considering the wider implications of your product roadmap and the product as a whole.</p>
<p>Likewise, if we're building out your product over the course of several weeks or months: it's inevitable that over the course of working together, we team up to discuss your product priorities and come up with a clear product strategy target to make sure we're moving in the right direction together!</p>
