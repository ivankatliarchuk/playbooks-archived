# Visual identity & branding

<p>Brand loyalty is driven by how a brand looks, feels and tells its story.</p>
<p>We familiarise ourselves with your narrative and your future vision before translating these into a visual identity that will engage and delight your audience.</p>
<p>Since 'branding' is about much more than simply visual identity, we also follow a <a href="https://logbook.hanno.co/beware-brand-designers/">lean branding approach</a>&nbsp;that places a lot of importance on how your brand chooses to communicate and interact with users. We'll help to guide you towards a compelling brand strategy that matches your <a href="https://hanno.co/playbooks/ops/services/org-purpose-strategy/">organisational purpose.</a></p>
<p><em>We'll update this page soon with a closer look at how we tackle this.</em></p>
