# Product design sprints & rapid prototyping

<p>We're a team of designers whose focus is on <strong>digital product design</strong>. That means that we're particularly experienced when it comes to developing digital products like apps and websites.</p>
<p>Our <strong>product design sprints</strong> are based on the <a href="http://www.gv.com/sprint/">Google Ventures design sprint model</a> and the <a href="https://www.ideou.com/pages/design-thinking">design thinking process</a> for creative problem-solving.&nbsp;</p>
<p>They're a great way to rapidly build and validate a prototype from scratch or to improve an existing product. In just a few intense days, we can work with you and your team to develop new ideas, overcome challenges and validate solutions quickly and with minimal resources.</p>
<p>We explore multiple possibilities and get stakeholders involved to co-create solutions. Together, we&rsquo;ll unleash our creativity and generate new ideas that will improve the user experience of your product in various scenarios.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Our constant iterative process is a cost-effective way to design solutions quickly until we achieve leading-edge experiences for a better user adoption.</p>
<p>Our design abilities and the framework we use&nbsp;can apply equally to <strong>service design</strong>&nbsp;and broader challenges, too.</p>
<p>To give a better idea of what can be achieved on a sprint, here's a short video from Pieter and Thibault of <a href="https://hanno.co/work/ava/">Ava</a> (formerly Transcense) talking about how we helped them run a prototyping and validation sprint with their team:</p>

<p>We'll be updating this page soon with more details on how we run our product design sprints. In the meantime, <a href="https://github.com/wearehanno/designthinking/wiki">take a look at our internal wiki</a>&nbsp;which gives some insight into how we run our sprints.</p>
