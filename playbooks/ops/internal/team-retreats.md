# Team Retreats

<p>Periodically, our whole core team gets together for team trips. We take care of finding accommodation and paying all travel expenses for employees to get there.</p><p>Since we rarely see each other face-to-face, these trips are a really important way for us to spend time together and learn how to grow and improve.</p><h3>Recent trips have included</h3><ul><li><a href="http://hanno.co/logbook/practice-what-you-preach">June 2013</a>: Spain (Valencia &amp; Barcelona)</li><li><a href="http://hanno.co/logbook/helipads-durian-monkeys-websites">January 2014</a>: Malaysia &amp; Hong Kong</li><li><a href="https://logbook.hanno.co/the-hanno-design-thinking-think-tank/">February 2015</a>: Argentina and Brazil</li><li><a href="https://logbook.hanno.co/rethinking-social-purpose-croatia/">August 2015</a>: Croatia</li><li><a href="https://logbook.hanno.co/team-retreat-valencia/">May 2016</a>: Spain (Valencia)</li><li><a href="https://logbook.hanno.co/shipmates-in-srilanka/">April 2017</a>: Sri Lanka</li><li>August 2017: Spain (Valencia)</li><li>January 2018: France (Valfr&eacute;jus)</li><li>March 2019: Spain (Gran Canaria)</li><li>January 2020: Italy (Dolomites)</li></ul>

<h3>Selecting a destination</h3>
<p>The destination for each trip is put to a team vote a few months before we depart.</p>
<h3>Trip format</h3>
<p>We've experimented with many trip lengths (from 1 week to 6 weeks) and itineraries (from training workshops to surf retreats).</p>
<p>Our current team trip format is for most of the team to join for 7-10 days including 2 weekends, with a 'core' 5 days in the middle where everyone will be around.</p>
<p>During the team trip, we&rsquo;ll be unavailable for client work. We schedule client sprints accordingly, to give us the time and space to make each team trip a success with little to no distractions.</p>
