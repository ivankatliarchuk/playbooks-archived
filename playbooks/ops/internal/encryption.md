# Encryption

<p>Protecting our data (especially if it's patient data or confidential data from a client project) is incredibly important. If your devices aren't properly encrypted, there's a risk that the data on it could be accessed by others - especially if you lose or sell the device.</p>
<p><strong>Every device which touches our data must be encrypted, and must stay that way.</strong> So once encryption is switched on on a device, it shouldn't be switched off, even if you think you've removed all of the data from it.</p>
<h2>How to do it</h2>
<p>Setting this up properly can take a few moments, but isn't especially complex if you follow the instructions below.</p>
<h3>On a Hanno-managed device</h3>
<p>For Hanno's own managed hardware, we have various automated processes to make sure encryption is in place by default, so you <em>shouldn't</em> need to apply any of the steps below. Please check with the team if you're unsure.</p>
<h3>On your Macs</h3>
<p>Follow <a href="https://support.apple.com/en-gb/HT204837">these instructions</a> to enable FireVault. Don't enable "iCloud FireVault recovery" (using your iCloud/Apple ID), because this can introduce security holes which an attacker could take advantage of.</p>
<h3>On your iOS devices</h3>
<p><em>In general, other than accessing emails, there should be no need for you to use a mobile device to access Hanno data. But regardless...</em></p>
<p>Follow <a href="https://ssd.eff.org/en/module/how-encrypt-your-iphone">these instructions</a> to encrypt your iOS devices such as iPhones and iPads.</p>
<p>Some additional steps you'll want to apply:</p>
<ul>
<li>If you back up your devices to iCloud (which we don't allow on Hanno-owned devices), please mark the setting to <a href="https://support.apple.com/en-gb/HT205220" target="_blank" rel="noopener">encrypt these backups with a password</a>.</li>
<li>Wherever possible, please exclude Hanno apps from being included in iCloud backups - see "Choose which apps to back up" <a href="https://support.apple.com/en-gb/HT204247" target="_blank" rel="noopener">here</a>.</li>
<li>Use a long passcode for your devices, and not a simple "1234" one.</li>
<li>Switch on "Erase Data" to delete data from the device after 10 failed login attempts - instructions <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/iphone-security-failed-passcode-attempts-2018-6?r=US&amp;IR=T" target="_blank" rel="noopener">here</a>.</li>
</ul>
<h3>On your Android devices</h3>
<p>Follow <a href="https://pixelprivacy.com/resources/encrypt-android/">these instructions</a> to ensure that encryption is properly enabled.</p>
<h3>On your Windows devices</h3>
<p>Follow <a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-gb/help/4028713/windows-10-turn-on-device-encryption" target="_blank" rel="noopener">these instructions</a> to enable BitLocker on your entire device.</p>
<h3>On your Linux devices</h3>
<p>Follow <a href="https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/Disk_encryption" target="_blank" rel="noopener">these instructions</a> to ensure that encryption is properly enabled.</p>
