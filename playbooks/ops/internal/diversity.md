# Diversity

<p>We're currently drafting a formal diversity policy to make clear our commitments on diversity. We'll update this page as it progresses.</p>
<p>Statistics for our <a href="https://hanno.co/team/">current team</a> (including all regular contributors and freelancers) are as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li>10 regular shipmates and contributors</li>
<li>80% white, 20% non-white</li>
<li>80% male, 20% female</li>
</ul>
<p>There are of course many more data points we can track to monitor diversity. We'll be updating this list soon with those which we feel are relevant.</p>
<p>We've <a href="https://logbook.hanno.co/improve-gender-diversity/">written about the topic of diversity on our blog in more detail</a>.</p>
