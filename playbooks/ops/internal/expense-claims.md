# Expense Claims

<p>We have a <a href="http://receipt-bank.co.uk/">Receipt Bank</a> account, which is where all employees file expense claims.</p>
<p>Here's the easiest way to use this:</p>
<h2><a id="user-content-during-the-month" class="anchor" href="https://github.com/wearehanno/playbook/wiki/Expense-Claims#during-the-month" aria-hidden="true"></a>During the month</h2>
<p>First, log in to ReceiptBank and set up your 'email in' address. It'll be something like <em><a href="mailto:yourname@receiptbank.me">yourname@receiptbank.me</a></em>. You can find this by navigating to <strong>Account Settings &gt; My Details &gt; Email-in</strong></p>

<p>Keep this address secret and add it to your <a href="https://www.google.com/contacts/u/0/?cplus=0">Google Contacts</a> (or you'll probably forget it). When you pay for an expense, forward the invoice PDF or confirmation message to your email-in address. This will also work if you take a quick photo of the bill or receipt on your phone and email it.</p>
<p>Your 'email in' will work from your personal email address as well as your work one. It'll actually work from any email account you send it from, which is why you should keep it secret!</p>
<p>ReceiptBank will then automatically process your email and extract the receipt totals and tax amounts. It'll take up to a day for it to do this, but it's all automated.</p>
<h2><a id="user-content-at-the-end-of-every-month" class="anchor" href="https://github.com/wearehanno/playbook/wiki/Expense-Claims#at-the-end-of-every-month" aria-hidden="true"></a>At the end of every month</h2>
<h3>Check and categorise your expense receipts</h3>
<p>Log in to ReceiptBank and check your receipts. Make sure that the totals and in particular, the tax amounts and accounting categories are correct.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Client entertaining</strong> is generally <span style="text-decoration: underline;">not allowable</span> as a deduction for corporation tax and VAT. Expenses can be filed as client entertaining, but you must mark these as 'No VAT'.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>You should create a recurring Asana task to remind yourself to do this at the end of the month.</strong>&nbsp;</p>
<h3>Create and publish an expense claim</h3>
<p>1. Group your invoices to form an <strong>Expense Claim.<br /></strong>2. <strong>Publish</strong> this claim into Xero.</p>
<p>It's important that you do it as an Expense Claim because otherwise the expenses won't be connected to your account, and you won't get paid for them.</p>
<p>Hanno shipmates can watch a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r0nPtXFTA6o&amp;feature=youtu.be">demo video here</a>, which shows you how to do this:</p>

<p>If expenses aren't claimed by the end of a quarter, it's not really possible for us to reimburse them because there are tax and VAT implications.</p>
<h3><a id="user-content-notes" class="anchor" href="https://github.com/wearehanno/playbook/wiki/Expense-Claims#notes" aria-hidden="true"></a>Notes</h3>
<ul>
<li>When you make an Expense Claim, make sure the "Publish To" option is set to "Expense Claims"</li>
<li>And set "Paid" as "No"</li>
</ul>
