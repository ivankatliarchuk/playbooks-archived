# The Weekly Update

<p>The team's Weekly Updates are currently sent out by Jon. They're posted to the team via an Asana announcement message every Monday.</p>
<h2>Structure and content</h2>
<p>There are a few recurring sections in the update:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Current status&nbsp;</strong>is a short update from Jon with his perspective on where we're at right now.</li>
<li><strong>Cash flow</strong> shows the financial summary for the team right now, including all major incoming and outgoing funds and debts.&nbsp;</li>
<li><strong>Team news, travelling and moods</strong> give a quick update on where everyone is located and what they're up to. It's partly based on the "Time Off" section in <a href="https://forecastapp.com/90585/schedule/projects">Forecast</a>.</li>
<li><strong>Projects</strong>&nbsp;work through our active sprints and internal projects and also sums up the major client consulting pitches that we're working on at the moment.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Creating the weekly update</h2>
<p>There's a recurring Asana task to tackle this on Mondays--it's currently held by Jon, but can be passed to other people when he's on holiday.</p>
<p>It gets stored in the <strong>Weekly Updates</strong>&nbsp;folder on Google Drive.</p>
<p>Whoever is responsible for it, should:</p>
<ul>
<li>Clone last week's update</li>
<li>Edit the file name and date</li>
<li>Fill in the sections.</li>
</ul>
