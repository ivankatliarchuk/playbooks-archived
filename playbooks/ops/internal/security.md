# Security

<p>Running your entire business online means you need to be more careful than usual about security.</p>
<p>Here's a selection of Hanno's <em>Security Rules</em> that we have in place to protect our client and team data:</p>
<h3>Internet</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Use our VPN:</strong> We use&nbsp;<a href="https://encrypt.me/">Encrypt.me</a> as a secure VPN for any employees or collaborators who are involved on a project. You should use this at all times if you're not working from a trusted home wifi network. You should also enable Encrypt.me on any mobile devices that you access Hanno data from.</li>
<li><strong>Don't connect to untrusted wifi</strong>&nbsp;(like airport wifi)</li>
<li><strong>Use 2-Factor authentication</strong> with every service which provides it, especially those where you might access client data (Google, GitHub etc). <a href="https://authy.com/">Authy</a>&nbsp;is a good app for managing multiple tokens and is a better option than SMS verification.</li>
<li><strong>Use long, secure passwords and store them in <a href="https://1password.com/">1Password</a></strong></li>
</ul>
<h3>Encryption</h3>
<p>Device encryption is important. We've put together instructions <a href="/playbooks/ops/internal/encryption">here</a> to explain how you can enable it correctly on all your devices.</p>
<h3>AntiVirus</h3>
<p>AntiVirus software is essential. Especially&nbsp;given the sensitivity of the data you might be working with. We install it on our own hardware, but all contractors should do the same, even on Macs. Here's a list of <a href="https://www.techradar.com/uk/best/best-mac-antivirus-software">free Mac AntiVirus tools</a>.</p>
<h3>Safe behaviour</h3>
<p>This is a very non-exhaustive list, but here are some other security guidelines which you should follow:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Never share your device with others</strong> - if you need to do this, create a new user account so they can log in separately and won't be able to access work data.</li>
<li>Use a separate device, partition or login for anything potentially "risky" such as installing unknown software.</li>
<li>Never sign up and transfer any client data to new cloud services without checking this with the team.</li>
<li><strong>Lock your machine when you leave it&nbsp;</strong>(<a href="https://www.cnet.com/how-to/7-ways-to-lock-your-macbook/">tips</a>).&nbsp;Never leave any of your devices unattended in public,&nbsp;<strong>especially</strong> if they are not locked - this includes leaving devices in open co-working spaces or coffee shops. Sounds excessive, perhaps, but you should take your laptop to the toilet rather than leaving it to reserve your spot in a coffee shop.</li>
</ul>
