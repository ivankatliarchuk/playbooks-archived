# Workdays

<p>The workday for a shipmate at Hanno is <strong>8 working hours</strong>--while in rare situations it may be a little longer, this is the goal we hold ourselves to.</p>
<ul>
<li>When working on a project sprint, the amount of time that will be spent on client work will be up to <strong>7 hours</strong> in a day.</li>
<li>The <strong>remaining hour</strong> of the day goes towards off-sprint work such as internal reviews, research, planning and internal work, all of which allows us to deliver better results when we&rsquo;re on a sprint.</li>
</ul>
<p>If any shipmate is consistently working longer than this, that indicates that there&rsquo;s a problem to be resolved in either their personal approach or our internal processes.</p>
<p>As a team, we are highly productive and <a href="http://hanno.co/logbook/investing-in-tools-no-brainer">invest heavily in tools</a> to allow us to be this way. Our philosophy is that the number of hours worked has no correlation with the quality of work produced.</p>
