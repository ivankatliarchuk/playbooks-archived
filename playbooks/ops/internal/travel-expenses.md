# Business Travel Expenses

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When a shipmate is travelling on an international business trip for Hanno, we&rsquo;ll cover your reasonable expenses to offset the extra cost of living that comes with travelling.</span></p>
<p>The process depends on your employment status:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Legal employees</strong>: you can follow the rules below for submitting expenses. You must file receipts in order to get the expenses.&nbsp;</li>
<li><strong>Independent contractors:</strong>&nbsp;we expect you to invoice us a larger amount if you're travelling to work with us.&nbsp;But you can&rsquo;t file expenses and receipts directly as these need to go through your own business. <strong>You&rsquo;ll need to negotiate any travelling fees and add this total to your next invoice</strong>.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>As a general rule, keep it lean, do your research, and use your judgement</strong>: if you wouldn&rsquo;t pay for something when you were at home because it&rsquo;s excessively expensive (a taxi ride around the corner instead of taking the tube) then please don&rsquo;t do it just because you&rsquo;re not picking up the bill. Higher Hanno profits allow us to pay the rest of the team more!</p>
<p><em>By the way, please keep in mind that these guidelines do </em><strong><em>not</em></strong><em> apply to team retreats.</em></p>
<h2><strong>Pre-trip: Travel costs</strong></h2>
<p>If you're an employee with your own Hanno credit card, that's the best way to pay for these costs. You won't need to pay from your own savings and won't need to submit an expense claim later on:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Return&nbsp;flights</strong>. Remember: international flights usually have <em>No VAT. </em>Check the booking terms and if they require you to travel using the credit card, make sure you actually have a physical card.</li>
<li><strong>Transfer fees to get to the airport</strong>.&nbsp;Please don't go via luxury limo.</li>
<li><strong>Pre-booked accommodation</strong>. We have a company AirBnb account - please use this for AirBnb bookings. Ask Jon for access if you can't find it.</li>
</ul>
<h2><strong>During the trip: Automatic expense budget</strong></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Once your flights, accommodation and airport transfers have been paid for, we also have a simple, automatic allowance for expenses.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">You don't need to submit an AP if you're spending within these limits on a work trip:</span></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>Up to &pound;200/week</strong><span style="font-weight: 400;"> in an expensive travel location (such as San Francisco).</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">In a cheaper location, it might be a little less - it&rsquo;s up to you to decide. Please decide on a provisional allowance before the trip.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>If you need a larger budget, submit an AP</strong>:&nbsp;<em>for example, if you need to take several long train rides and taxis in order to visit a lot of VC investors in a single day, this will probably be pricey and would blow through your default budget.</em></span></li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This budget is designed to cover the </span><strong>additional costs of travelling for work once you get to your destination</strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">. It can be used for expenses like:</span></p>
<ul>
<li>Travel - taxi/Uber receipts and airport transfers, public transport tickets/receipts</li>
<li>Food - the extra cost of eating out (at affordable places, not fine dining for the sake of it), or basic groceries to keep you fed and hydrated.</li>
<li>Phone - the cost of a SIM card</li>
</ul>
<h2><strong>Employee expense submission guidelines</strong></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Please keep in mind:</span></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you don't have a receipt and you don't submit it into Expensify, we can't pay you for the expense. Download the <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/expensify-receipts-expenses/id471713959?mt=8">Expensify app</a>&nbsp;to make this easier for yourself.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">You can&rsquo;t file for a cash top up to take yourself up to the default expense budget. If you only have receipts for &pound;170 of legitimate purchases for a 1-week trip, we can&rsquo;t just transfer you an extra &pound;30 as an expense payment so that you reach the &pound;200 limit.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Expense claims are subject to </span><strong>very strict</strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">&nbsp;tax regulations. If the expense is something you&rsquo;d buy while you were at home (a coffee on your way to work; a beer after work) then </span><strong>you can&rsquo;t expense it</strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">All expenses need to be </span><strong>wholly, exclusively and necessary for business</strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">. HMRC can challenge costs if they think there is a mix of business and personal, and we&rsquo;ll not be able to repay you for these.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Your expense report will be publicly visible to anyone on the team who wants to look at it later on. Make sure you&rsquo;re willing to justify any purchases you make.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>Please avoid 'client entertaining costs'</strong> where you can. We can repay you for expenses, but we can&rsquo;t claim back corporation tax on them. This means they're expensive for us.</span></li>
</ul>
<h2><strong>The process:</strong></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This is pretty much the same as the usual process. But watch out for taxes!</span></p>
<ol>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Take photos of every receipt while travelling. Make sure it is clear and detailed, to avoid confusion later.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Send the image to Expensify - their mobile apps&nbsp;are the best way to do this.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">When you return from the trip, check all the transactions in Expensify.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">When checked, file all your expenses in a single Expense Report and publish it.</span></li>
</ol>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Please check the VAT on your expenses before you submit the claim:</span></p>
<ul>
<li>Items bought when abroad should be saved in the "<strong>Travel (International)</strong>" - you should make sure they have no VAT or tax on them. If an item is $100 + $5 sales tax, mark it as $105 with no VAT.</li>
<li>If you're in the EU, this same rule applies. We can only reclaim VAT on services from the EU when they're delivered to the UK. So make sure EU expenses have 'No VAT' as well.</li>
<li>Check your invoices - for services like AirBnb, the accommodation itself won't have any&nbsp;tax on it, but the 'service fees' will, and we can claim this. Ask if you're unsure.&nbsp;</li>
<li>For services in the UK (including transport) - we can probably claim the tax back. File the item in the most likely category and check your receipt to see if any VAT is stated on it.</li>
</ul>
