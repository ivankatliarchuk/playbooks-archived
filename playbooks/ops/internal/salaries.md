# Salaries

<p>As part of being a self-managing team, each shipmate is also able to <strong>choose their own salary</strong>.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ve done the research, analysed lots of examples about how self-managed salaries have been done successfully in the past, and we think we&rsquo;ve come up with a fairly robust way of doing them.</p>
<h2>The salary change process</h2>
<p>It might seem a little bit complex at first, but in reality, it&rsquo;s far simpler than either a perfect formula which encompasses all possible variables or an opaque, politicised negotiation and secret list of team salaries:</p>
<ol>
<li>Along with regular <em>State-of-Play </em>updates to the team, we also include a financial advisory on the current company financial status, with a <strong>general opinion and recommendation for the salary direction</strong> that the team should be thinking about for this upcoming review, based on our financial status. That&rsquo;s not an instruction, but rather, an informed opinion&ndash;under the principles of self-management that we&rsquo;re moving towards, people are free to make their own decision, taking our opinion into account (and disregarding it if they choose)</li>
<li><strong>The team react to this guidance with a round of feedback and opinions</strong>. Some might even disagree with the assessment and call us out on that. Some might request more information or clarifications. We'll do our best to provide that.</li>
<li><strong>Shipmates take time to think about the finances and their own salary needs</strong>. They can ask for advice or opinions from others while they&rsquo;re putting together this proposal, and we&rsquo;re suggested taking into account a few factors when working out a figure - those are listed below.</li>
<li><strong>The shipmate puts together a proposal</strong>, in whatever format they choose, for how much they want to receive in the next few months. It&rsquo;s recommended that they explain their thought process in sufficient detail, especially if it&rsquo;s an increase since the last salary review because this will make it easier for their shipmates to understand their thinking and motivations. They post this on Loomio.</li>
<li>Just as the team reacted to the general salary proposal, now we have <strong>a reaction round from the team to this individual shipmate&rsquo;s salary proposal.</strong> This isn&rsquo;t a battle: it&rsquo;s a conversation, and the shipmate is obliged to <em>listen</em> to the feedback from the team.</li>
<li>Shipmates are <strong>free to modify their salary proposal based on that feedback</strong>, but they don&rsquo;t have to do so if they disagree with the advice. That&rsquo;s the power which comes along with self-management! This idea of listening to opinions, but not being obliged to follow them if you strongly believe otherwise, is part of what we call our <a href="https://hanno.co/playbooks/ops/mission/advisory-process/"><em>Advisory Process</em></a>, which we&rsquo;re documenting at the moment and trialling as we shift to become a <em>teal-thinking organisation</em>.&nbsp;</li>
<li>Under the Advisory Process, there is&nbsp;<strong>1 core ground for a salary proposal being declined</strong>: if there is a <em>genuine risk that the salary being proposed would cause irreparable harm, or move Hanno backwards.</em></li>
<li>Pay for every member of the team is <strong>documented in a spreadsheet for everyone to see and refer to</strong>, along with the forecasted upcoming payments to the whole team, so that we can accurately plan our outgoing costs for the next 3 months.</li>
</ol>
<h2>Questions to ask when deciding on a salary figure</h2>
<p>We have shifted away from an individualistic, subjective approach to salary APs and the primary consideration when making an AP is&nbsp;<strong>what is my value to Hanno?</strong></p>
<p>We found it necessary to make this shift in financially challenging times because we needed to make sure that salaries were linked to business value, not just an emotional justification.</p>
<p>After business value, a few other secondary factor questions tend to play a role in team compensation:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>How much do I need to earn, in order to live and to be satisfied with my pay?</strong></li>
<li><strong>How do the next 3-6 months look for me?</strong> Thinking about longer periods should help to discourage big swings in compensation, which will make it hard to budget.</li>
<li><strong>How much can Hanno afford to pay? </strong>The whole team has access to our financial dashboard and budgeting dashboard hosted by <a href="http://floatapp.com/">Float</a>, which uses the live financial data from our <a href="https://www.xero.com/">Xero</a> account. So there&rsquo;s total transparency to how much money the company is making and spending, which is critical for this whole process to work.</li>
<li><strong>How much do my fellow shipmates earn? </strong>We have a spreadsheet which lists how much everyone in the team has been paid each month, this year.</li>
<li><strong>How much do other people in my city/country earn?</strong></li>
<li><strong>How much do people with my skills and responsibilities earn elsewhere?</strong></li>
</ol>
<h2><strong>A note on retrospective salary increases</strong></h2>
<p>This is very much related to our <a href="https://hanno.co/playbooks/ops/mission/advisory-process/">AP rules</a>&nbsp;banning retroactive proposals.</p>
<p>If we know we upcoming outgoings of &pound;200k in the next 3 months, we'll plan our finances and outgoing around this to ensure we have financial stability.</p>
<p>When someone proposes a salary increase, it's considered by the team based on the financial status of Hanno. If it involves an increase of $1000/month, we'll bake that into our financial road map if the AP is approved.</p>
<p>Being able to plan effectively depends on having a clear view of those obligations.</p>
<p>If someone is to present a proposal to say "I think I deserve more money for my work in the past year and I now want to claim 12 months of backdated pay, totalling $12,000, this creates an immediate, unplanned financial hit to the team.</p>
<p>So the presumption with salary proposals is that while you're welcome to request a <strong>salary increase</strong>&nbsp;for the future, <strong>you can't retroactively increase your salary for work done in the past</strong>.</p>
