# Hiring

<p><strong>We're always on the lookout for designers and makers to grow our team. These include full-time and regular collaborators.</strong></p>
<h2>Who we're looking for</h2>
<ul>
<li>For current positions, check out our&nbsp;<a href="https://hanno.co/jobs">jobs page</a>. To receive email updates about new shipmate openings, <a href="https://twitter.com/wearehanno">follow us on Twitter</a> or <a href="https://hanno.co/newsletter">sign up to our newsletter</a>.</li>
<li><strong>Awesome freelance collaborators</strong>. We can't make any promises, but occasionally we have opportunities for non-core shipmates to join us on sprints. If you can work within our system of&nbsp;weekly, full-time sprints&nbsp;for 2+ weeks at a time, and think you'd bring a serious skill to the team, feel free to get in touch.</li>
<li><strong>Smaller teams</strong>. If you're a smaller, more specialist team who works in a similar way and think there's a chance we can team up on a project of yours, please let us know! We have a good network of collaborators already, but if you can bring exciting new projects to us, we'll always be ready to listen.</li>
</ul>
<p>If you think we&rsquo;re missing a huge opportunity to do something and think you can fill that gap, then please go ahead and fill in our <a href="https://hanno.co/jobs/open/">Open Applications</a>! We&rsquo;re always willing to listen to great ideas, and perhaps you&rsquo;ll be able to convince us that we need you on board.</p>
<h2>Our current deal-breakers</h2>
<p>There are a couple of things which make it very unlikely that we&rsquo;ll consider you as a new hire, for now:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>If you&rsquo;re not a fully-fluent English speaker</strong>: we blog and write a lot, as a team, and we have quite a few non-native speakers on the team. We know that you don&rsquo;t have to be a native English speaker in order to be a great designer, but we have come to a team decision that for our next few shipmates, we really do need them to have fluent written and spoken English, so we can rebalance the team.</li>
<li><strong>Junior hires, interns and apprentices</strong>: sadly, we&rsquo;ve not set up to take on board junior shipmates right now, because we don&rsquo;t have the time to fully train and build people up. To help us step up the quality of our work, we need more experienced shipmates to join us.</li>
</ul>
<h2><a id="user-content-hiring-tips" class="anchor" href="https://github.com/wearehanno/playbook/wiki/New-Hires#hiring-tips" aria-hidden="true"></a>Hiring tips</h2>
<p>Here are things we like to see from people who message us:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://logbook.hanno.co/hey-designer-get-hired/">Try and write some stuff</a></li>
<li><a href="https://logbook.hanno.co/designer-get-hired-again/">Please don't send a dull CV: build yourself a website!</a></li>
</ul>
<p>If we&rsquo;ve not worked together before, then the first project we will work on will be a (fully paid!) sprint together, so that everyone can see how it feels to work together.</p>
<p>If the sprint goes well, we&rsquo;ll talk about what we&rsquo;d both need to do to make things happen again on a more regular basis, whether that's as a full-time core team member, or as a recurring collaborator.</p>
