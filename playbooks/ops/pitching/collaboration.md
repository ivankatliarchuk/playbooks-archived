# Partners and Collaborators

<p>Where we feel it would help us to do a better job on a project, we may bring in collaborators to help us. These contractors will be booked on the same, weekly basis, and will become full-time members of the project during the booking.</p>
<p>Confidentiality of project and client information is important, so each of these contractors will sign a standard <em>Independent Contractor Agreement</em>. This will be sent out from HelloSign, and sets out our standard confidentiality terms, along with other conditions for working on the project.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ll also send a single booking document, which will set out the dates we&rsquo;re booking to work together.</p>
<p>Collaborators will join the project's Slack channel and be added to the project management tools (such as Asana) that they need in order to carry out their roles.</p>
