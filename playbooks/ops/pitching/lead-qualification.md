# Lead Qualification

<h3>New leads</h3>
<p>Brand new projects typically come about when the client fills out our <a href="https://hanno.co/contact/">Contact form</a> form. We have a <a href="https://zapier.com/">Zapier</a> hook, which adds the enquiry as a task inside our <em>Pitches</em> project inside Asana.</p>
<p>Pitches are sorted according to their current status: iceboxed, paused, qualifying, negotiating. The whole team is added as a follower to the ongoing pitch, so they're kept informed.&nbsp;</p>
<h3>Assessing the lead: project criteria</h3>
<p>In order to progress, enough members of the team must express interest in the project for us to think we could assemble a team to work on it. If there&rsquo;s no team interest, we&rsquo;ll apologetically decline the lead. Where appropriate, we&rsquo;ll offer a suggestion for where they might look next.</p>
<h4>What sort of clients and sectors does Hanno look for?</h4>
<ul>
<li>In short, we are keen to work on projects which help us achieve <a class="internal present" href="https://hanno.co/playbooks/ops/mission/values">our mission</a>.</li>
<li>In order to take on a project, enough of our shipmates must volunteer to work on it, for us to be able to build a project team. This means that projects must be sufficiently appealing. Otherwise, we'll turn them down.</li>
<li>Our big specialty is building digital products. We're a UX design team--projects of that sort are the best fit. We like informal, forward-thinking and friendly clients who are fun to work with. Needless formality slows things down. Tech startups are a good fit; brick and mortar retail stores tend not to be. Disruptive, paradigm-changing projects which help those who are weak, are particularly exciting.</li>
<li>We are a social good business, but that doesn't mean we work exclusively with social good businesses. For social good projects, we apply our <a href="https://hanno.co/playbooks/ops/mission/social-criteria">Social Criteria</a> to help us choose projects.</li>
<li>We will not work on projects which do harm. This includes tobacco and fossil fuel projects.</li>
</ul>
<h4>What sort of leads are worth pitching?</h4>
<p>There are a few dealbreakers. All pitched clients will need to be:</p>
<ul>
<li>Able to afford our usual fees, for a team of at least 2 people. We do however reduce fees for other social businesses or non-profits.</li>
<li>Willing to work with a team which is at least partly remote.</li>
<li>Willing to work in Sprints, where appropriate, especially on Engineering projects.</li>
</ul>
<h3>The Call/Meeting</h3>
<p>If the initial team reaction is favourable, we&rsquo;ll line up a video call with the lead. For us, it&rsquo;s important that this is a <em>video</em> call and not just an audio one, so that we can get to know each other better. This isn't a kickoff call, and it shouldn&rsquo;t be with the lead&rsquo;s entire team.</p>
<p>Here, we want to understand the client better, and hear their ambitions for their project. Just as they need to make sure we can deliver, we need to do the same on our side.</p>
<h3>The agenda</h3>
<p>Some key questions that we'll discuss:</p>
<ol>
<li>Find out why. Why did the client contact Hanno--why do they feel that Hanno would be a good match?</li>
<li>Discover their vision. Gauge technical expertise and level of expectations. Do they sound smart, focused and knowledgeable about their goals and business? A lack of technical expertise is a solvable problem, but needs to later be factored into budgets, for increased project time and more thorough training.</li>
<li>Understand a little more about their requirements. This is not a deep scoping session, yet, but we'll likely need to fill in a few gaps in our knowledge and understand a little more about the work that's required. This will help us to understand the team that&rsquo;ll be needed for the project.</li>
<li>Discover their level of commitment. Who will we be working with--who will be the <em>product owner</em> at the client's end? This <a href="http://hanno.co/logbook/ceo-product-owner">shouldn&rsquo;t be the CEO</a>.</li>
<li>Sound out their budget. Be accepting of a degree of inexperience - not all clients know exactly how much this will cost. But be very cautious if their budget expectations are vastly out of sync with what&rsquo;s required for the project to succeed. Squeezed budgets don&rsquo;t allow the time and thought to deliver great results, and we should make sure we don't put ourselves in a position where the client might be left unhappy at the end of the project.</li>
<li>Discuss a very loose timeline. Ahead of the call, the team will check out our upcoming project schedule on <a href="https://forecastapp.com/">Forecast</a> to see what our availability is. But we won't commit to a project deadline or set schedule on the call, because this will need to be discussed with the rest of the team beforehand. But we really do need to have a general idea of what budget the client has available, in order to give helpful advice.</li>
</ol>
<p>Team members should be careful not to commit to specific dates in early client calls, so that the client isn't disappointed when these dates are investigated more deeply and turn out to not be achievable. Be aware that getting through the early stages of contract signing and invoice payment can be more time-consuming than you might expect.</p>
<h3>After the call</h3>
<p>The shipmate(s) involved at our end will report back to the rest of the team with a summary of what was discussed.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;ll also make a preliminary recommendation to either accept, or reject the lead--gut instincts are important. Again, enough team members must be willing to take on the project. If they&rsquo;re not, we&rsquo;ll regretfully decline.</p>
<p>We may also decline the project if we feel that while the client is keen, Hanno wouldn&rsquo;t be the best choice for the project. We want to help all of our clients achieve their goals. Sometimes, we&rsquo;re simply not the right team for the job. If there&rsquo;s <a href="http://hanno.co/logbook/reinventing-wheel">a product or service out there that would be more suited to a client's budget</a>, we&rsquo;ll tell them about this, even if it means we're giving up a potential project in order to save the client money. We feel that&rsquo;s an ethical route to take, and will leave everyone in a better position in the long-run.</p>
