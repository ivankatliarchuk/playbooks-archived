# Quotes & Estimates

<h3>Pricing &amp; Engagement Summaries</h3>
<p>If we&rsquo;ve been able to gain consensus for the project and assemble a team, and we've chosen to run a sprint, we&rsquo;ll send over an <em>Engagement Summary</em>, which sets out:</p>
<ul>
<li>The number of team members</li>
<li>The project duration</li>
<li>The project goal</li>
<li>The price of the project (and where appropriate, the weekly rate)</li>
<li>The currency for the project - this will be in GBP, USD or EUR, depending on the client's location.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Invoices</h3>
<p>We are a UK incorporated company, and so all invoices and rates are subject to VAT. The currency used will be the one agreed in the Engagement Summary.</p>
<p>Payment is taken via bank transfer. We recommend that clients check their bank fees: if you're making large payments in foreign currencies, it may be cheaper to use <a href="https://transferwise.com/">TransferWise</a>.</p>
<h3>Scheduling Sprints</h3>
<p>Before booking a project sprint into our team schedule, we will send an upfront invoice for the first week/milestone of the sprint. This is the only invoice we send which is not on net-14 payment terms--rather, it is due ASAP.</p>
<p>During discussions with the client up to this point, we&rsquo;ll give them approximate estimates for when the project might be able to be scheduled. However, no dates are fixed until we have a signed contract, confirmed <em>Engagement Summary</em> and the first invoice has been paid.</p>
