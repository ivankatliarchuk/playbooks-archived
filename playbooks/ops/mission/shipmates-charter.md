# The Shipmate's Charter

<p>This is what gives you the authority to self-manage and act independently. If you don&rsquo;t follow these rules, you have no authority to take an action. And an action taken without authority is not a valid one.</p>
<p>In a nutshell, here are the basic authority and duties you accept by filling a role at Hanno. This is a modified and simplified version of what you find in the Holacracy wiki and constitution--there are flaws in it, arising from our lack of clearly defined roles at the moment, which established Holacracy practitioners will see. But this is an acceptable compromise for now.</p>
<h3>The 4 key rules:</h3>
<ol>
<li><strong>Always follow the <a href="https://hanno.co/playbooks/ops/mission/advisory-process/">Advisory Process</a></strong>. Failure to do so means you have no authority to take a decision. Make sure others are notified before you take an action.</li>
<li><strong>Always be transparent.</strong> This system will fail if we do not work in the open. Make sure you don&rsquo;t hide your actions from others. Communicate regularly and fully.</li>
<li><strong>Never be dishonest</strong>. Self-management depends on trust. Abuse the trust placed in you, and this will be grounds for your immediate dismissal from the team.</li>
<li><strong>Always use your common sense.</strong> As long as you take the action that you genuinely feel is right, and follow the advisory process, you&rsquo;ll have no issues. Act with autonomy and purpose!</li>
</ol>
<h3>Your authority</h3>
<ul>
<li>Using your best judgement and common sense, you have the authority to do anything that makes sense to you to enact your role&rsquo;s purpose or accountabilities, as long as it doesn&rsquo;t violate a rule, is proposed using the Advisory Process, and is genuinely in the best interest of Hanno.</li>
<li>Your authority is restricted by the legal terms of your employment contract, which cannot be exceeded. Only company directors have the authority to perform legal duties for the company and adjust its structure and governing purpose.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Your basic duties, to do regularly</h3>
<ul>
<li>Consider your role and responsibility within the team, and work on projects and actions that are aligned with these.</li>
<li>Process &ldquo;<a href="http://wiki.holacracy.org/index.php?title=Tension">Tensions</a>&rdquo; (both issues and opportunities) that you sense in your role. This may mean taking on new projects and actions, or bringing issues to the attention of the rest of the team so they can be resolved. It&rsquo;s up to you, the only thing you may NOT do is ignore those Tensions.</li>
<li>Prioritise your time in order to work on the most important projects/actions on your list. It&rsquo;s up to you to decide what&rsquo;s most important, but you must align your actions with the team&rsquo;s <a href="https://hanno.co/playbooks/ops/mission/values">mission</a>. Track your projects and actions in a list on Asana, regularly review and update that list, and make sure it is transparent to other shipmates. You must be transparent with your prioritisation decisions upon request.</li>
<li>Prioritise communication through the Advisory Process and following these rules over doing your actual work, even if that seems counter-intuitive. If you have an objection to this, raise <em>Tension</em>.</li>
</ul>
<h3>The role of the Captain</h3>
<ul>
<li>The Captain (currently <a href="https://hanno.co/team/jon">Jon</a>) is <em>responsible</em> for &lsquo;holding the space&rsquo;, enforcing these rules and making sure that <em>teal</em> principles are always followed.</li>
<li>While he will avoid interfering in self-management wherever possible, he has the discretion to do so if he feels it is essential, or if the system has a bug or failure. This is especially so while we are making the transition to an effective <a href="http://www.reinventingorganizationswiki.com/Teal_Organizations">teal system.</a></li>
</ul>
