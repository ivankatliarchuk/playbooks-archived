# Mission & Core Values

<h2>Our mission</h2>
<p>We believe that design has the power to solve some of the greatest challenges facing humanity.</p>
<p>Our mission is to help brilliant, socially motivated organisations that want to take on major social problems related to <strong>health &amp; wellness</strong>.</p>
<h2>Our Values</h2>
<h4>Never settle.</h4>
<ul>
<li>Be pioneers. Don&rsquo;t accept the status quo--use our skills to find better ways of doing and being.</li>
<li>Grow. Fulfill our potential. Constantly push ourselves outside of our comfort zone. Create a culture of learning and continuous improvement in everything we do.</li>
</ul>
<h4>Design a better world.</h4>
<ul>
<li>Maximise good. Find ways to create the biggest possible positive impact on the world.</li>
<li>Help, empower and educate. Lead by example and be role models. Use and share our knowledge and skills to make others better off. Inspire others to follow our path.</li>
<li>Be stewards. Leave things in a better place than we find them. Work for the good of people and the planet. Plant the seeds that will benefit future generations.</li>
</ul>
<h4>Be authentic.</h4>
<ul>
<li>Bring our whole selves to work. Be true to who we are, and mindful of others. Act with honesty and integrity: always do what we promise we&rsquo;ll do.</li>
<li>Work in the open. Default to transparency. Share the good and the bad. Don't hide from difficult situations or challenges.</li>
<li>Put purpose above profit. Be motivated to achieve our purpose not to relentlessly pursue profit. Where there&rsquo;s purpose, everything else follows.</li>
</ul>
<h4>Stay humble.</h4>
<ul>
<li>Keep our egos in check. Work to serve others, not to further our own cause. Be a better version of you.</li>
<li>Trust in the wisdom of the team. As a collective, we are stronger than the individual. Make space for every voice to be heard.</li>
<li>Treat feedback as a gift. Accept and give it fearlessly.</li>
</ul>
<h4>Take responsibility.</h4>
<ul>
<li>Make things happen. Actively look to own roles, seize opportunities and be proactive for the benefit of the team.</li>
<li>Use your common sense. When in doubt, do what feels right.</li>
<li>Get things done. Work smarter, and achieve maximum results with sustainable effort.</li>
</ul>
