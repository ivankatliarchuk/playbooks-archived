# Communicating on projects

<p>When working on a project, the tools vary, based on what we feel will be the best fit for the client and the project in question. We&rsquo;ll often use Asana to run projects, but if the client has a defined workflow and we need to integrate into it, we&rsquo;ll switch from anything from GitHub issues to apps such as JIRA.</p>
<p>While we use Asana for nearly all our internal tasks at Hanno, it's common for us to use Trello as a task management tool on projects as it's a little more visual and versatile and can be easier for clients to grasp.</p>
<p>We are huge fans of Google Docs. If written communication is not in Asana, it will be in a Google Doc. If we find ourselves writing a long message in Basecamp, we stop, turn it into a Google Doc, and send that link via a Basecamp message or an Asana task.</p>
