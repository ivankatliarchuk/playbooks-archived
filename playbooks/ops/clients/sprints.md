# Running Sprints

<p id="sprints">We hold fast to the philosophy that great results on complex challenges come from building a great team around the problem. We don&rsquo;t believe that any of our shipmates should be working solo.</p>
<p>So we build small, cross-functional teams for each project. This means that depending on the project needs, we&rsquo;ll typically have 3 shipmates working on each client sprint.</p>
<p>We also don&rsquo;t feel that great work comes when our attention is split between multiple projects. A consistent project team, which doesn&rsquo;t change on a regular basis, is the best way to build great relationships with our clients and to make sure that team is productive and understands the project deeply. So team members will stay on the same project for the whole sprint, working full work-weeks on that project, rather than working on multiple projects at once.</p>
<h2 id="sprint-schedules">Sprint schedules</h2>
<p>Team schedules are shown in Forecast, and teams are responsible for managing their own schedules and also requesting resources from other team members, as needed. Where possible, we will aim to avoid having sprints run back-to-back. Downtime in between sprints is for internal work, including marketing, blogging, and building team tools.</p>

<p>Where we have an ongoing project that is expected to pause after a sprint completes, and then resume a few weeks or months later, that client should be given priority over any new project leads or commitments. Ideally, we&rsquo;ll look to give them first refusal on the timeslot before another project is booked into it. However, all available project timeslots are handled on a first-come, first-served basis. The client must commit to subsequent sprints, and organise a booking and week 1 deposit, before that timeslot will be reserved for them.</p>
<h2 id="pre-kickoff">Pre-Kickoff</h2>
<p>Our working process is extremely intense. To make sure we can start off at full-speed and deliver value to the client, we&rsquo;ll send over some research and prep tasks to the client about a week ahead of kickoff. These will cover topics such as:</p>
<ul>
<li>The product&rsquo;s business model (or intended model)</li>
<li>User feedback on the current product, if it exists</li>
<li>The company and product history so far</li>
<li>Competitors</li>
<li>Key project objectives</li>
</ul>
<p>Getting solid answers to these questions really does have a big impact on the quality of work in Week 1. If we don&rsquo;t have this, we will inevitably make much slower progress.</p>
<h2 id="day-1">Day 1</h2>
<p>The first day of the project is always a busy one. The aim is to lead into it by getting hold of a set of solid worksheet responses from the client beforehand. Then, as a team, we&rsquo;ll spend the first few hours looking through all the information we&rsquo;ve received so far, and leading into a kickoff session with the client.</p>
<p>Day 1 is where we&rsquo;ll look to get a deep understanding of what the project is going to cover, and what the client has already learnt so far. We&rsquo;ll work together with the client to set out priorities for the sprint, broken down into weekly milestones. The process of working together to create these stories is important. The entire team (and the client) can all discuss the merits of each feature/task being added to the roadmap.</p>
<p>At the end of this process, we&rsquo;ll end up with a much clearer project outline and specification, and a good idea of what to tackle first.</p>
<p>We often use Trello for collaborative storyboarding - we like the simple UI and ease of use for clients. It is highly visual and allows us to get them involved in prioritising stories and including some basic agile on the project, regardless of whether we go for a full-blown agile sprint process. We explained this in a bit more detail in a <a href="http://slid.es/jonlay/rapid-ui-development-for-web-apps">recent presentation</a>, and you can also view an <a href="https://trello.com/board/fbk-frontendbook-roadmap/51ac9da8411c61033b003856">example Trello project</a> to see it in action.</p>
