# Paying invoices with Transferwise

<p>We have local EUR, GBP and USD accounts and issue invoices in all 3 currencies.</p>
<p>For clients who don't operate in any of the 3 currencies, we highly recommend <a href="https://transferwise.com/">Transferwise</a> for making invoice payments.</p>
<p>Transferwise is a currency exchange service built by former engineers at Skype. It's extremely reputable and has received a lot of press coverage. It's our view that Transferwise doesn't carry any real risks and we use it to make the vast majority of our own outbound transfers too--we've transferred hundreds of thousands of pounds with the service and have had no issues.</p>
<p>The fee structure at Transferwise often leads to <strong>significant savings</strong>&nbsp;when compared to most (but not all) traditional banks. By allowing you to transfer money at the <em>real</em> rate, you don't lose out on commission, especially when making big invoice payments.</p>
<h2>Create your account</h2>
<p>As long as your <a href="https://transferwise.com/help/article/1569835/basic-information/supported-currencies">currency is supported</a> (most are, including USD, EUR and most other European and major international currencies), you can send money via Transferwise.</p>
<p>Account setup takes a day or two and like any financial service will require you to have proof of identity like your passport and utility bills.</p>
<h2>Transfer funds</h2>
<p>Once your account is up and running, visit the 'create transfer' page.</p>
<p>If your Hanno invoices is in GBP, select your own currency at the top, and GBP at the bottom.</p>
<p>Then <strong>click into the input field for GBP</strong> and enter the GBP value of the invoice you're going to pay. By doing this, Transferwise will lock the payment total so that the exact GBP total is transferred.</p>

<p>Then, specify that you're wanting to make a payment to a <strong>new recipient</strong> and that this person is a <strong>Business or charity</strong>.</p>
<p>When entering the payment information, adding the Hanno email address will send us a handy little notification too, saving you some time.</p>

<p>Once you've added all our bank account details, Transferwise will ask you to transfer the corresponding amount in your own currency, into their local bank account.</p>
<p>So if you're in Australia, they'll give you an Australian bank account number for you to send your money to. Everything else will be automated and you'll be notified once the payment gets sent. Simple!</p>
